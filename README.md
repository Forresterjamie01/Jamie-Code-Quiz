# Code-Quiz-Assignment
This assignment is not complete but based on my conversation wit Jerome, I wanted to show that i tried my best to start the quiz and develop it the best way I knew how.

I started with the html and css because that's what i know best.

I did not get to complete the Java Script, but here is some psuedocode on what i would do.
What: Connect the html created questions with javascript
how: import them using, systemprintouts, importing, loops, and classes
why: in order to get the user to be able to complete the assessment efficiently.
